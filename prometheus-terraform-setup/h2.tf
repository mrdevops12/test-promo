1. What I Tried
•	Used Terraform + Helm to install the kube-prometheus-stack into a new namespace (demo-monitoring).
•	Added flags (skip_crds, global.rbac.create=false, prometheusOperator.createCustomResource=false) so Helm wouldn’t try to recreate cluster-wide CRDs or RBAC objects that already exist.

2. What Went Wrong
•	CRDs and ClusterRoles are cluster-wide, not per-namespace.
•	Our customer’s cluster already has those CRDs (Prometheus, ServiceMonitor, etc.) and ClusterRoles from a previous install.
•	By telling Helm not to install them, we avoided the “already exists” errors—but the Prometheus Operator then had no CRDs to work with and no webhook certificates, so its setup jobs kept crashing or waiting forever.
•	

3. How I Troubleshot
•	Checked what already exists

kubectl get crd
kubectl get clusterrole | grep prometheus
•	Tried disabling cluster objects in Helm
Added --skip-crds and --set global.rbac.create=false etc., but the Operator still failed because it needs those CRDs up front.
•	Looked at pod status and logs
o	Admission-webhook jobs in a CrashLoopBackOff.
o	Node-exporter pods stuck Pending.
This confirmed that without the CRDs and webhooks, the Operator can’t start correctly.
o	

4. Why CRDs & ClusterRoles Matter
•	CRDs tell Kubernetes about new resource types (Prometheus, Alertmanager, ServiceMonitor).
•	ClusterRoles/Bindings give the Operator permission to watch and manage resources across namespaces.
•	Even a “namespace-only” install chart still expects those cluster-wide pieces to be in place.


Planning to next steps: 
 May I know can I Evaluate AWS Managed Service for Prometheus and Managed Grafana, which avoids these in-cluster CRD/RBAC conflicts entirely.
